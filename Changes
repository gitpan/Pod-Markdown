Revision history for Perl extension Pod-Markdown

1.321     2012-10-27T01:23:56Z

    - Improved list handling including support for ordered (numbered)
      and nested lists.  Thanks Yasutaka ATARASHI!

1.320     2012-04-30T23:30:11Z

    - End markdown output with a newline to be more consistent with...
      everything.  If this causes a problem for you please report it.

    - Enable pod2markdown to accept file paths as arguments
      (for both input and output (defaulting to STDIN/STDOUT)).
      Thanks to Mike Doherty for the suggestion [rt-76726].

1.301     2012-04-25T03:56:11Z

    - Fix double-interpolation of list headings
      which caused escaping of the markdown characters.
      Thanks to motemen for the pull request (gh-1).

    - Add TODO tests for improving list handling.

1.300000  2012-04-08T00:08:25Z

    - Document that characters in varbatim paragraphs and code sections
      are not escaped.
    - Bump release number to demonstrate major formatting difference
      of last change (backslash-escaped characters).
      (Forgot to do it last time.)

1.200001  2012-04-07T23:16:23Z

    - Escape characters that are special to Markdown
      (but normal in Pod) with backslashes.
      Thanks to Florian (fschlich at zedat dot fu-berlin dot de)
      for the initial patch (rt-75620).

    [Enhancements]
    - Handle POD formatting codes embedded in links
    - Render Z<> and X<> as blank strings
    - Handle numeric (hex, octal, and decimal) E<> escapes
    - Convert spaces in S<> to &nbsp;

    [Format Changes]
    - S<> no longer produces backticks (code sections).
      This is consistent with perlpod and perlpodspec.
      Use something like S<C<$x + $y>> if you intend it to be treated as code.
    - Author meta tag with no title meta tag does not produce a leading newline.
      This was considered a bug.

    [Tests]
    - More tests, increased coverage

1.120001  2011-11-27T04:07:30Z
    [Prereqs]
    - Require version 1.10 of Pod::ParseLink (core in perl 5.12)
      to handle alt text with schemes/absolute URLs.
      This can be changed from "requires" to "recommends" if it poses a problem.

    [Test Fix]
    - Skip tests (rather than fail) for alt text with absolute url
      if Pod::ParseLink < 1.10

1.120000  2011-11-19T05:44:51Z
    [Enhancements]
    - Use Pod::ParseLink to dramatically improve (and simplify) link parsing
      (including sections, alternate text, and man pages).

    [Format Change]
    - NOTE: L</foo> now becomes ["foo"](#foo) instead of [foo](#pod_foo).
      This is consistent with perldoc, perlpodspec, and Pod::Simple::(X)HTML
      which is used for metacpan.org and search.cpan.org.
      No '#pod_' id/name attributes were ever generated so the links
      probably weren't very useful (and probably still aren't).
      If this change presents a problem please report it.

1.110732  2011-11-18T04:06:06Z
    - Change /\h/ to /[ \t]/ for compatibility with older perls.
      Thanks to David Golden for reporting [rt-71961]

1.110731  2011-11-18T03:28:34Z
    - Ensure verbatim pod becomes verbatim markdown
      by increasing indentation if necessary [rt-72414]
    - Co-maintainership granted to RWSTAUNER

1.110730  2011-03-14 10:11:52 Europe/Vienna
    - make bulleted lists work at least minimally (thanks ap)

1.103490  2010-12-15 16:12:31 Europe/Vienna
    - improved L<> link handling
    - Enabled interpolation of I<these thingies> in headers

1.100860  2010-03-27 14:31:43 Europe/Vienna
    - converted the distribution to Dist::Zilla-style
    - bin/pod2markdown now uses '#!/usr/bin/env perl'

0.02 Sun Oct  4 16:30:06 CEST 2009 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
    - E<foo> now outputs '&foo;'
