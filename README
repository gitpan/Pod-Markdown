DESCRIPTION
    This module subclasses Pod::Parser and converts POD to Markdown.

METHODS
  initialize
    Initializes a newly constructed object.

  as_markdown
    Returns the parsed POD as Markdown. Takes named arguments. If the
    "with_meta" argument is given a positive value, meta tags are generated
    as well.

  command
    Handles POD command paragraphs, denoted by a line beginning with "=".

  verbatim
    Handles verbatim text.

  interior_sequence

    command within a block of text which appears as a command name - usually
    a single uppercase character - followed immediately by a string of text
    which is enclosed in angle brackets.

  format_header
    Formats a header according to the given level.
